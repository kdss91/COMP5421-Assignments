1) The project contains header files Shape.h, Triangle.h, Rectangle.h, Rhombus.h, AcuteTriangle.h, RightTriangle.h, and SlotMachine.h 

2) The implementation files are Shape.cpp, Triangle.cpp, Rectangle.cpp, Rhombus.cpp, AcuteTriangle.cpp, RightTriangle.cpp, and SlotMachine.cpp 

3) There is one driver file shape_slotmachine_driver.cpp which tests all the functionalities of Shape class and its children. It executes the playing of the slot machine. It also contains the main function and is the starting point of project.

4) The main function of shape_slotmachine_driver executes shape_examples() function which tests class Shape functionalities such as constructor, toString() function, insertion operator overload, and draw() function. Main function also executes play_shape_slot_machine() function which test the run() function of the Slot Machine.

5) Compiled and executed using Visual Studio.
