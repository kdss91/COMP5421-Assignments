2) The function is_palindrome() checks whether a string is palindrome or not.

3) The function second_max() finds the second largest element in a container.

4) The function testCountStringLambda() counts the strings of length n in a vector using lambda.

5) The function testCountStringFunctor() counts the strings of length n in a vector using function objects.
 
6) The function testCountStringFreeFun() counts the strings of length n in a vector using free function.

7) The function charFrequency() reads some characters from keyboard and counts the frequency of each character(except whitespace).

8) The function multisetUsingMyComparator sorts a vector of strings according to increasing lengths and lexicographical order.

9) The main function is the starting point of the project and tests all the above functions.

10) Compiled and executed using Visual Studio.
