1) The project contains two header files List.h and LineList.h

2) There are two implementation files List.cpp and LineList.cpp

3) There is one driver file LineListTestDriver.cpp which tests all the functionalities of List and LineList. It also contains main function and is the starting point of project.

4) There are two input files input_a.txt and input_b.txt

5) Compile and run using Visual Studio 2017.

6) list_a is first loaded from input_a.txt . Testing of operations like remove, empty, get, pop_back, pop_front, assignment= operator, insert, and print are performed in function test_linked_list_operations. 

7) list_b is loaded from input_b.txt . assert function is used to check for equality of list_a and list_b contents.

8) list_c is created from list_a using assignment= operator. assert function is then used to check for equality of list_a and list_c.

9) list_d is created from list_a using copy constructor. assert function is then used to check for equality of list_a and list_d.

10) The function test_line_operations is used to test the functionalities of class List like empty, pop_back, push_back, length, and capacity.
